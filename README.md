Quick and Easy guide to rushing a character through content in the Game Diablo 2 resurrected

Feel Free to leave ??? or !!!  I kind of doubt anything will change, but it if does, I will update it

** TEST COMMIT **


**TLDR:** \
Get all waypoints; at a min, get the following: \
Act 1: Catacombs Level 2 \
Act 2: Far Oasis, Lost City, Arcane Sanctuary, Canyon of the Magi, *Halls of the Dead Level 2 if you don't have a Horadric Cube* \
Act 3: Travanical, Durance of Hate Level 2 (can't get until you have smashed the compelling orb and went in to Durance of Hate) \
Act 4: River of Flame \
Act 5: Ancients Way, Worldstone Level 2 (can't get until you have completed the ancients and entered wsk) \


**Steps Overview:** \
Act1 - Andariel Kill \
Act2 - collecting parts for the Horadric Staff, Killing the Summoner, Killing Duriel \
Act3 - collecting body parts, breaking the Compelling Orb, Killing Mephisto \
Act4 - Diablo Kill \
Act5 - Ancients Kill, Baal Kill \

**Repeat the process on Nightmare and Hell difficulty**

**ACT 1 - Rogue Encampment** \
Rusher - go to Andariels lair (floor 4 of catacombs) setup TP for rushee, kill Andariel \
Rushee - After Andariels is dead, go back to town and take warrifs caravan to act 2 /

**ACT 2 - Lut Gholain** \
Rushee - need 4 items \
- Horadric Cube - Halls of the Dead \
- Horadric Staff -  Maggot Lair - in Far Oasis \
- Head Piece - Claw Viper Temple - Lost City \
  
Rushee - Cube staff and headpiece to make staff to open Duriels Lair \
Rusher - go to Tal Rashas tomb (rushee has quest and can find the symbol, symbol will also be the missing symbol on summoners platform) ]  \ 
 Rushee - Put staff in orifice and open Duriels tomb. \  
Rusher - Enter the tomb, make sure rushee has entered and lay the smack down on Duriel \
Rushee - talk to Tyreal, go back to the city, talk to Jerhyn and then Meshif who will take you to the docks of Kurast. \

**NOTE!  Rushee will need to walk to tomb, for whatever reason, the rusher setting up a port directly in Tal Rashas tomb **will not work**  so just escort the rushee to the tomb, clear it and let rushee follow you**

**ACT 3 - Kurast** \
**NOTE - After patch 2.4 rushee needs to smash the compelling orb to get to the level 2 waypoint.  We will need to collect some items and cube them up** \

**Khalim's Eye** - Sparkly chest in Spiders Cavern located in Spider Forest.  **Note - don't confuse with Arachnids Lair near the waypoint** \
**Khalim's Brain** - Sparkly Chest Flayer Dungeon level 3 - located in Flayer Jungle \
**Khalim's Heart** - sparkly chest Kurast Sewers Level 2 - Upper Kurast \
**Khalim's Flail** - Travinical - will drop off the last named council Member \ 

Rushee  - cube up the parts and make Khalim's will.  Use Khalim's will to smash the orb \
Rushee  - enter the durance of hate and get the waypoint to level 2 from Rusher \
Rusher  - go down to mephisto and TP rushee to you. Kill Mephisto \
Rushee - go back and enter the now available red portal and take it to act 4 \

**ACT 4 - Diablo** \
Rusher - go to chaos sanctuary, TP Rushee to center (where diablo spawns) \
Rusher - open all the seals, I suggest killing all the seal bosses and minions \ 
Rushee - Stay in center, as long as you are right up against diablo when he spawns, he wont hurt you, his attacks go right over your head \
Rushee - After Diablo is dead, go back and talk to Tyreal, he will open a port to act 5 \

**Act 5 - Ancients/Baal** \
Rusher - Take Ancients Way wp.  go to the stairs to Arreat Summit and set up a portal for Rushee. \ 
Rushee - Take portal stay out of kill zone with ancients but stay in range.  If you die, just stay dead, you will get credit and xp \
Rusher - Kill the Ancients. \

As of current, you need to be a min level to get xp for ancients
  - **Normal** no level requirement
  - **Nightmare** Level 20
  - **Hell** Level 40
  - This is due to stop low levels from getting an obscene amount of xp :)
  
Rushee - After they are dead, enter worldstone keep \
Rushee - get WP for worldstone keep level 2 \
Rusher - Clear Worldstone keep and go to Throne of Destruction, make a TP for rushee \
Rushee - Take TP and stay put till Rusher engages.  Baal has some AOE, so donâ€™t get too close.  If you die, stay dead until all is clear.


Thats all there is!  Feel free leave ??? or !!!
